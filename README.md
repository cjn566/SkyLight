# Skylight

This repository is the code that generates that animated light patterns that display on Skylight. The code is written in C++ and runs on a Teensy 3.2 with the help of the FastLED and Octo2812 libraries.

Skylight is an art installation that was brought to several festivals in the summer of 2016. It consists of a large collection of geometric boxes layed out in a hexagonal pattern and suspended overhead. Each box has addressable LEDs inside and is covered by a diffusive panel.
